# EER Framework Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for expanding the EER Framework test suite to ensure comprehensive coverage of all core functionality. The goal is to create a robust testing framework that validates the correctness, reliability, and performance of the EER Framework.

## Test Coverage Goals

1. **Component Lifecycle**: 100% coverage of all lifecycle hooks and transitions
2. **Event Loop**: Full testing of both `loop` and `ignite`/`terminate`/`halt` approaches
3. **Component Interaction**: Complete testing of component communication patterns
4. **Error Handling**: Validation of error conditions and recovery mechanisms
5. **Memory Management**: Verification of memory usage and leak prevention

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

#### Component Lifecycle Tests
- Component initialization with various props/state configurations
- Mounting process (`will_mount` and `did_mount` hooks)
- Update cycle (`should_update`, `will_update`, `release`, and `did_update` hooks)
- Unmounting process (`did_unmount` hook)
- Skip variants of lifecycle hooks
- Hook variants of lifecycle hooks

#### Event Loop Tests
- `loop` macro with single and multiple components
- `ignite`/`terminate`/`halt` approach with various exit conditions
- Context transitions during loop iterations
- Loop termination and cleanup

#### Component Interaction Tests
- Props application via `apply`
- Forced updates via `react`
- Context management with `use` and `with`
- Component dependencies and data flow

### 2. Integration Tests

- Multi-component systems with complex interactions
- State propagation between components
- Event handling across component boundaries
- Conditional component mounting/unmounting

### 3. Performance Tests

- Memory footprint during component lifecycle
- CPU usage during component updates
- Scaling with increasing component count
- Resource usage in constrained environments

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Weeks 1-2)
- Create test fixtures for basic component patterns
- Implement tests for all lifecycle hooks
- Test both event loop approaches
- Validate basic component interactions

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Weeks 3-4)
- Test complex component hierarchies
- Validate state propagation patterns
- Test error handling and recovery
- Implement performance benchmarks

### Phase 3: Edge Cases and Optimization (Weeks 5-6)
- Test boundary conditions
- Validate memory management
- Test in resource-constrained environments
- Optimize based on performance metrics

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Framework
- Extend the existing test harness with additional assertions
- Add timing and memory usage measurements
- Implement test fixtures for common patterns

### Continuous Integration
- Automate test execution on each commit
- Track test coverage metrics
- Monitor performance benchmarks over time

### Documentation
- Document test patterns and best practices
- Create examples of testable component patterns
- Provide guidelines for writing testable components

## Success Criteria

1. **Coverage**: Achieve >90% code coverage for core functionality
2. **Reliability**: All tests pass consistently across environments
3. **Performance**: Establish baseline performance metrics and prevent regressions
4. **Documentation**: Complete test documentation for all core features

## Next Steps

1. Create test fixtures for component lifecycle testing
2. Implement basic lifecycle tests
3. Add event loop tests
4. Develop component interaction tests
5. Establish performance benchmarks
