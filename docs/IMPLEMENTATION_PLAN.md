# EER Framework Implementation Plan

## Current Architecture

The EER Framework is a lightweight component-based system for embedded applications with:

- Component lifecycle management (mount, update, unmount)
- Event-driven architecture
- Two event loop approaches: `loop` and `ignite`/`terminate`/`halt`
- Memory-efficient design for embedded systems

## Improvement Areas

### 1. Code Organization and Consistency

- [x] **Consolidate Header Files**: Reduce duplication between `eer_app.h`, `eer_comp.h`, and `eers.h`
- [x] **Standardize Naming Conventions**: Ensure consistent naming across macros and functions
- **Documentation**: Improve inline documentation and examples

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- **Memory Usage**: Further reduce memory footprint for ultra-constrained devices
- **Cycle Counting**: Add optional cycle counting for performance-critical applications
- **Interrupt Handling**: Improve ISR integration with component lifecycle

### 3. Feature Enhancements

- **Component Dependencies**: Add explicit dependency management between components
- **Conditional Rendering**: Support for conditional component mounting/unmounting
- **Error Handling**: Improved error propagation and recovery mechanisms
- **Debugging Tools**: Add debug mode with additional runtime checks and logging

### 4. Testing and Validation

- **Unit Test Coverage**: Expand test suite to cover all core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Add tests for component interactions
- **Benchmarking**: Create benchmarks for memory usage and execution time
- **Static Analysis**: Integrate static analysis tools

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Stabilization (Current)

- Finalize the component lifecycle API
- Ensure consistent behavior between `loop` and `ignite` approaches
- Fix any existing bugs in core functionality

### Phase 2: Code Quality (Next)

- Refactor header files to reduce duplication
- Improve documentation
- Add more comprehensive tests

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization

- Profile and optimize critical paths
- Reduce memory usage
- Improve interrupt handling

### Phase 4: Feature Expansion

- Add component dependencies
- Implement conditional rendering
- Enhance error handling

## Design Principles

1. **Minimal Overhead**: Keep runtime overhead as low as possible
2. **Predictable Behavior**: Ensure deterministic execution
3. **Flexibility**: Support different programming styles and use cases
4. **Embedded-First**: Optimize for constrained environments
5. **Clear Mental Model**: Make the component lifecycle easy to understand

## Contribution Guidelines

1. All new features must include tests
2. Performance-critical code must include benchmarks
3. Documentation must be updated with code changes
4. Breaking changes require migration guides
