# EER Framework Implementation Plan

## Current Status

The EER Framework has undergone significant improvements and is now in a stable state with:

- [x] Consolidated header files with clear separation of concerns
- [x] Standardized naming conventions across macros and functions
- [x] Improved documentation with detailed API reference
- [x] Robust component lifecycle management
- [x] Memory-efficient design for embedded systems
- [x] Two event loop approaches: `loop` and `ignite`/`terminate`/`halt`
- [x] Comprehensive examples demonstrating framework usage
- [x] Versioning system and release process

## Version Roadmap

### v0.2.x (Current)
- Focus on stability and robustness
- Bug fixes and documentation improvements
- No API changes

### v0.3.0 (Planned)
- Performance optimizations
- Memory usage improvements
- Cycle counting for performance monitoring

### v0.4.0 (Planned)
- Component dependencies
- Conditional rendering
- Enhanced debugging tools

### v1.0.0 (Future)
- Complete, stable API
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Production-ready for embedded systems

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Stability and Robustness

- [ ] **Error Handling**: Improve error detection and reporting
- [ ] **Edge Case Testing**: Test component behavior in unusual scenarios

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Further reduce memory footprint for ultra-constrained devices
- [ ] **Cycle Counting**: Add optional cycle counting for performance-critical applications
- [ ] **Interrupt Handling**: Improve ISR integration with component lifecycle

### 3. Feature Enhancements

- [ ] **Component Dependencies**: Add explicit dependency management between components
- [ ] **Conditional Rendering**: Support for conditional component mounting/unmounting
- [ ] **Debugging Tools**: Add debug mode with additional runtime checks and logging

### 4. Testing and Validation

- [ ] **Unit Test Coverage**: Expand test suite to cover all core functionality
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Add tests for component interactions
- [ ] **Benchmarking**: Create benchmarks for memory usage and execution time
- [ ] **Static Analysis**: Integrate static analysis tools

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Stability Improvements (Current - v0.2.x)

- [ ] Add comprehensive error checking
- [ ] Ensure consistent behavior across all component operations
- [ ] Add more defensive programming techniques

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization (v0.3.0)

- [ ] Profile and optimize critical paths
- [ ] Reduce memory usage further
- [ ] Improve interrupt handling
- [ ] Add cycle counting for performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Feature Expansion (v0.4.0)

- [ ] Add component dependencies
- [ ] Implement conditional rendering
- [ ] Enhance error handling
- [ ] Add debugging tools

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (v1.0.0)

- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive examples
- [ ] Finalize API and ensure backward compatibility
- [ ] Create migration guides for breaking changes

## Design Principles

1. **Minimal Overhead**: Keep runtime overhead as low as possible
2. **Predictable Behavior**: Ensure deterministic execution
3. **Flexibility**: Support different programming styles and use cases
4. **Embedded-First**: Optimize for constrained environments
5. **Clear Mental Model**: Make the component lifecycle easy to understand
6. **Robustness**: Handle edge cases and errors gracefully

## Contribution Guidelines

1. All new features must include tests
2. Performance-critical code must include benchmarks
3. Documentation must be updated with code changes
4. Breaking changes require migration guides
5. All code must handle null pointers and edge cases
6. Version numbers must be updated according to semantic versioning
